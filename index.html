    <h1>Site Percolation</h1>
    <p>
        Percolation theory has its origins in the study of porous media: What's
        the critical density of a medium such that a liquid can pass through it?
        It has since found application in epidemiology (how dense does a population
        have to be for a disease to spread?) or ecology (how many trees per area
        until a forest fire can spread through the whole system?).
    </p>
    <p>
        All these questions can be formulated as "how many entities per area/volume
        do we need to form a giant component - a component which includes a non-vanishing
        part of the whole system?". In this explorable, we demonstrate that there's a
        critical density of occupied lattice site which separates two phases: one where
        no giant component exists (no liquid can pass through) and one where there
        exists a giant component (liquid may pass).

    <h2>The Model</h2>
    <p>
        On a square lattice of side length N, each lattice site is occupied with probability p.
        when two occupied sites touch, they connect to build a component. If a third site touches
        one of the first, it belongs to the same component and so forth. With increasing
        occupation probability p clusters can potentially grow.
